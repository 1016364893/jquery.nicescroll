Nicescroll (as nice scroll for browsers) is a jquery (since 1.5) plugin, for nice scrollbars with a very similar ios/mobile style.
It supports DIVs, IFrames and document page (body) scrollbars.
Compatible with Firefox 4+, Chrome 5+, Safari 4+ (win/mac), Opera 10+, IE 6+. (all A-grade browsers)

Only vertical scrollbars supported in this version.

Warning for IE6 users (who uses IE6 yet? Please updgrade to a more stable and modern browser), some feature can't work for limitation of the browser.
Document (body) scrollbars can't appears, old (native browser) one is used.
Some issues with IFrame scrolling.


* FEATURES

- simple installation and activation, it works with NO modification of your code. (some exceptions can happen, so you can write to me)
- very stylish scrollbars, with no occupation on your window (original browser scrollbars need some of page space and reduces window/div usable width)
- you can stile main document scrollbar (body) too!! (not all script implements this feature)
- on all browsers you can scroll: dragging the cursor, mouse wheel (speed customizable), keyboard navigation (cursor keys, pagup/down keys, home/end keys)
- scroll is smooth (as modern tablet browsing), speed is customizable
- tested for all major browsers but with extended support, including IE6, Safari on Mac and IE10 preview!
